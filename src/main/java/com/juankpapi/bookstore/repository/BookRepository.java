// ======================================
    - Transactions are used to ensure the data is kept in a consistent state
    - DB transaction properties: ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
    - Atomicity: Indivisible and irreducible series of database operations such that either all occur, or nothing occurs. Thus, it prevents updates to the database occurring only partially,
    - We use JTA API to start, commit and rollback transactions
    - Here is what the specification says about each of the six transaction attributes:
        + Required - If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, the method executes within the client's transaction. If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container starts a new transaction before running the method. Most container-managed transactions use Required.
        + RequiresNew - If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, the container suspends the client's transaction, starts a new transaction, delegates the call to the method, and finally resumes the client's transaction after the method completes. If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container starts a new transaction before running the method.
        + Mandatory - If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, the method executes within the client's transaction. If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container throws the TransactionRequiredException. Use the Mandatory attribute if the enterprise bean's method must use the transaction of the client.
        + NotSupported - If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, the container suspends the client's transaction before invoking the method. After the method has completed, the container resumes the client's transaction. If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container does not start a new transaction before running the method. Use the NotSupported attribute for methods that don't need transactions. Because transactions involve overhead, this attribute may improve performance.
        + Supports - If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, the method executes within the client's transaction. If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container does not start a new transaction before running the method. Because the transactional behavior of the method may vary, you should use the Supports attribute with caution.
        + Never - If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, the container throws a RemoteException. If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container does not start a new transaction before running the method.

- A Bean is an object that is managed by Java EE contaoner
- In Java EE most objects are Beans, except for JPA Entities (Persitance)
- Extra services given by the container to a Bean
	+ services such as lifecycle management, interception or injection
- In terms of code, with very few exceptions, every Java class with a default counstructor is a Bean in Java EE
	+ It can have any annotation and can define any method
	+ Does not implement and interface
	+ Does not extend a specific class


// ======================================
// =      INJECTION EXPLANATION         =
// ======================================
- Service given by the container
- Beans depend on other beans
- Beans don't create their own dependencies (objECts). They delegate this task to the container
- Inversion of control: External container choose the dependency instead of the Bean
- CDI (Context and Dependency Injection)
	+ Java EE specification taking care of Dependency Injection (DI)
	+ Loose coupling, strong typing
	+ Container injects bean's references into other beans
